 RL task in N=53 Community participants.   Data collected from 2019-2021 in the CRCL at UNM.   The paper [Campbell, E., Singh, G., Claus, E.D., Witkiewitz,K., Costa, V.D., Hogeveen, J; & Cavanagh, J.F. Electrophysiological markers of aberrant cue-specific exploration in hazardous drinkers]  Should be coming out in print soonish.  Your best bet for understanding this task  would be to read that paper first.   For more info on triggers and outputs, see BEH_EXPLAIN.m file in code folder.  - James F Cavanagh 03/06/2023
